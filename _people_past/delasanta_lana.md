<!--- <b>Lana Delasanta</b> is an upcoming fourth year graduate student in the Ecological Psychology Ph.D. program within the Perception, Action, Cognition Division. She is also affiliated with the Center for the Ecological Study of Perception and Action and the Connecticut Institute for the Brain and Cognitive Sciences. Lana's research interests stem from her personal experiences with choir and music making in group settings as it facilitates social bonding and collective effervescence that she aims to capture in a quantifiable way. In addition to this, she also has a vested interest in political perception, value judgements, and productive conversations in the current digital age and the goals of her ongoing research projects are to better understand how to combat polarization and misunderstanding among people. Aside from her academic endeavors, Lana also has a podcast, photography business, and a love of all things politics.--->
