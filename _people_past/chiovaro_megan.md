<!---<b>Megan Chiovaro</b> is a fourth year Ph.D. student in the Perception, Action, Cognition - Ecological Psychology Division of the Psychological Sciences Department at UConn. She is affiliated with the Center for the Ecological Study of Perception and Action, the Connecticut Institute for the Brain and Cognitive Sciences, and the Science of Learning and Art of Communication NSF NRT Program. Megan's research interests include collective action, social dynamics, and cross-species similarities during social coordination. Her work rests on complex-dynamical systems theories, utilizing time series and nonlinear methods to capture the wildness and variability that is deep-rooted in social events. The underlying questions driving her studies are 'How can we improve the outcomes of leaderless human groups?' and 'Will leaderless human groups adapt the same successful coordination patterns as social insect colonies if places in a similar context with similar constraints?' Megan's work aims to identify cross-species similarities and create a universal understanding of leaderless group action."--->
